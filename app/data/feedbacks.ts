    text: "Not only did Natacha provide an exceptional Frontend, but she also helped us 'beautify' certain parts of the UX Design. Apart from CSS and HTML she is very proefficient with Javascript/React which helped us add interactive elements to the website. She's available almost 24/7 and is a very pleasant person to work with. Not only did she stick to the deadline, but she delivered way faster than the initial expectations. She's very patient and looks at every detail of the UX. People in UX say that 'Pixel Perfect' Designs are not possible. Natacha proved them wrong. Highly recommended!",

    text: "Natacha was an excellent, high-caliber addition to the team. We were simultaneously building new features, improving our coding conventions, and upgrading to the NextJS 14 app router. Natacha took it all in stride! She contributed to each of those different initiatives, often at the same time in the same PR. She grew considerably as a developer over the course of the project, and I wouldn't hesitate to hire again for our next project.",

    text: "Natacha's skill with core CSS and React is clear and enabled rapid turnaround and high quality work on our website development project. More than that, she quickly learned new tools in the Gatsby framework to enable us to optimize site load times and integrate the Ghost blog as a content source for our site. She was responsive, her communication was clear, and she was easy to work with and actively participated where appropriate to maintain project issue tracking in Gitlab.",

    text: "Natacha did a great job! Delivered our request on time and done extremely well the first time. We only had a few small questions and she quickly got back to us and provided screencasts going over the parts we had questions about. I also appreciate that she asked all needed questions at the beginning to clarify exactly what was needed. After we answered them, she understood perfectly what we needed and went to work. It's amazing to find someone you can trust to go off and do great work and we will definitely be trusting more HTML project to her in the future.",
